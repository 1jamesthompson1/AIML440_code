# Dynamic SUNRISE

Dynamic sunrise is an algorithm that uses a dynamic number of learners throughout the learning process to maximise exploration at the begining and provide efficient compact exploitation at the end.

The code for the implementation has been distilled and adapted from Sunrise' authors implmentation: https://github.com/pokaxpoka/sunrise.
