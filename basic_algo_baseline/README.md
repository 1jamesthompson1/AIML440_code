Here is the code used to perform experiements on the "baseline" continuous control algorithms.

The baseline algorithms I will use are:
- PPO
- SAC
- TD3

The goal here is that I am covering a range of methods that should give me a reasonable baseline.

I will aim to run them these benchmarks:
- Ant
- Humanoid
- Inverted double pendulum
- Pusher
- Hopper
- Humanoid
- Half cheeta
- Swimmer
