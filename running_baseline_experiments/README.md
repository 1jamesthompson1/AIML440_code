Here is the code used to perform experiements on the "baseline" continuous control algorithms.

The basic baseline algorithms I will use are:
- PPO
- SAC
- TD3
The basic algorithms will be run using stable baseline.

I will also run experiments on the more recent models. Each will be run using the original implementation if possible.
- TQC
- RedQ
- DropQ
- CrosQ

The goal here is that I am covering a range of methods that should give me a reasonable baseline.

I will aim to run them these benchmarks:
- Ant
- Humanoid
- Inverted double pendulum
- Pusher
- Hopper
- Humanoid
- Half cheeta
- Swimmer
